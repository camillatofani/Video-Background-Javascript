### Project description
<a name="description"></a>

Create a page with video on background and with controls for play and pause the video.


### Technical information
<a name="technical"></a>

The massive part of the project was the css code.
Actually the javascript part is really simple.

It's divided into 3 steps:
- Locate the Play and Pause button
- Locate the video element
- Add the class for the button switch to its click and add the .pause() and .play() methods to the video element when the button is clicked

That's it!

To make sure everything was in the right place I added a preloader to the page.
When the page is loaded I add the .hide-preloader class to the preloader element which contains the property 'visibility' on 'hidden'.
